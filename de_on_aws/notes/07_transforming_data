| CHAPTER 7 - TRANSFORMING DATA TO OPTIMIZE FOR ANALYTICS             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Transforming Data

    - We transform data to optimize for analytics and create value for an organization.  Some transformations
        can be generically applied to a dataset (ie convert raw data to Parquet), while some use
        business logic and vary according to data and business requirements.



- Types of Transformation Tools

    - Apache Spark

        - Spark is an in-memory engine for working with large datasets, providing a mechanism to split a
            dataset among multiple nodes in a cluster for efficient processing.

        - Data can either be processed in batches or in near-real-time using Spark Streaming.


        - Within AWS, you can run Spark with multiple AWS services:
            
            - AWS Glue for serverless Spark
            - Amazon EMR for a managed service
            - AWS container services (ECS or EKS) to run a Spark engine in a containerized environment
            - Use a managed service from an AWS partner such as Databricks


    - Hadoop and MapReduce

        - Hadoop is a framework for working with large datasets on a cluster of machines.  Before Spark,
            tools like Hive and MapReduce were the most popular way to transform and process large
            datasets.

        - Apache Hive provides a SQL-like interface for working with large datasets, while MapReduce 
            provides a code-based approach to processing large datasets.

        - For use cases with massive datasets that cannot be economically processed in memory, Hadoop
            MapReduce may be better suited.  However, for many use cases, Spark provides significant
            performance benefits.

        - HDFS is still commonly used as the ingest and target storage for Spark processing jobs.

        - Within AWS, you can run a number of Hadoop tools with the EMR service, including Hive, HBase,
            Yarn, Tez, Pig, and many others.


    - SQL

        - SQL is a common method for data transformation, if you don't need the versatility of a code-based
            approach.  

        - While we focus mostly on data lakes as the target for our data in this book, there are times
            where the target of our transformations may be a DW such as Redshift or Snowflake.  In those
            cases, the data may be loaded into the warehouse, and the transformations then performed in 
            SQL.


    - GUI-Based Tools

        - There are a number of cloud and commercial products that are designed to provide a drag-and-drop
            style approach to creating complex transformation pipelines.  These tools tend not to be
            performant or versatile, but they require minimal coding skills.

        - Within AWS, the Glue Databrew service is designed as a visual data preparation tool.  A user
            can select from a library of 250 common transformations, without needing to write any code.

        - AWS Glue Studio is another service that provides a visual approach to ETL design, developing
            Spark transformations.  It allows you to create complex ETL jobs that join and transform
            multiple datasets, then review the generated code.

        - Outside of AWS, there are also many commercial products that provide a visual approach to ETL
            design.  Popular products include Informatica, Matillion, Stitch, Talend, Panolpy, Fivetran,
            and many others.



- Data Preparation Transformations

    - Protecting PII Data

        - Often, datasets we ingest my contain PII, and there may be governance restrictions on which
            PII data can be stored in the data lake.  We need a process to protect PII as soon as possible
            after it is ingested.

        - This is often the very first transformation that is performed.  In many cases, it is done in a
            separate zone of the data lake.  This zone will have strict access controls.  A best practice
            would be to have the anonymizing process run in a totally separate AWS account.  After the
            process is complete, the files can be moved into the raw zone.

        - There are open source libraries to complete the anonymization process using Spark, which could
            be run using Glue or EMR.  It could be done in Athena if all you need is a SHA-256 hash.


    - Optimizing the File Format

        - There are a number of file formats optimized for data analytics.  Apache Parquet is the most
            popular.  Parquet files are columnar.  They also contain metadata about the data they store
            (including schema information, statistics like the minimum and maximum of each column, and
            the number of rows in the file).

        - Parquet files are also optimized for compression.  A 1 TB dataset in CSV format can be stored
            in about 130 GB in a Parquet format.  Parquet supports multiple compression algorithms, but
            Snappy is the most widely used.

        - Since services like Athena are billed based on the amount of compressed data scanned, these
            optimizations result in significant savings in storage and computation.

        - If you have a lot of Parquet files, some queries may be able to just look at the metadata
            instead of scanning the entire files.  For example, if you just need to count the rows in a
            table, you can just look at the metadata, and Parquet won't charge you for the query.


    - Optimizing with Data Partitioning

        - Partitioning is another common optimization.  It relates to how the data files are organized
            in the storage system for a data lake.

        - 'Hive partitioning' splits the data from a table to be grouped together in different folders,
            based on one or more columns in the dataset.  You can partition the data on any column, but
            partitioning based on data is the most common.


        - For example, if you had sales data for the last 4 years, you could group it together by year:

            datalake_bucket/year=2021/file1.parquet
            datalake_bucket/year=2020/file1.parquet
            datalake_bucket/year=2019/file1.parquet
            datalake_bucket/year=2018/file1.parquet

          Then, when you run a SQL query with 'WHERE Year = 2018', the analytics engine only needs to 
            open up a single file in the folder.


        - Your partitioning strategy requires a good understanding of how the data will be used.  If you
            partition by year, but most queries span multiple years, your partitioning strategy will not
            be effective.  Also, there is some overhead to scanning across multiple partitions in a query.


        - You can also partition across multiple columns.  For example, if you regularly process data at
            the day level, you could implement this strategy:

            datalake_bucket/year=2021/month=6/day=1/file1.parquet


        - However, you want to ensure you don't end up with a large amount of small files.  The optimal
            size of Parquet files in a data lake is 128 MB - 1 GB.  The Parquet file format can be split,
            so multiple nodes in a cluster can process a file in parallel.

            (Note files compressed using gzip are not splittable)


    - Data Cleansing

        - Data cleansing is often one of the first tasks to be performed after ingesting data.  It helps
            ensure the data is valid, accurate, consistent, complete, and uniform.


        - Source datasets may be missing values in some rows, have duplicate records, have inconsistent
            column names, use different formats, etc.  The data cleansing process works to resolve 
            these issues in raw data to better prepare the data for analytics.

          Some sources may be nearly completely clean on ingestion (ie relational dbs), while others may
            need a lot of cleansing (data from web forms, manually entered data, IoT data from sensors).


        - Common cleansing transformations include:

            - Ensuring consistent column names
            - Changing column data types
            - Ensuring a standard column format
            - Removing duplicate records
            - Providing missing values



- Business Use Case Transforms

    - In a data lake environment, you typically ingest data from many different source systems into a raw
        (aka landing) zone.  Then, you perform the data preparation transformations and apply cleansing
        rules to the data, and store it in the clean zone.

      At this point, you may also apply updates to the data set with CDC-type data and create the latest
        view of the data.


    - Once that is done, you are going to apply transformations that deliver value to the business for a
        specific use case.  After all the whole point of the data lake is to bring varied data sources
        from across the business to a central location, to enable new insights to be drawn from across
        those datasets.


    - Data Denormalization

        - Some data systems are highly normalized (ie relational dbs), and each table is linked to other
            tables through foreign keys.  Structuring tables this way has write-performance advantages
            for OLTP systems, and helps ensure referential integrity of the database.

          Normalized tables also consume less disk space, since data is not repeated across multiple tables.


        - When it comes to running OLAP queries, having to join data across multiple tables incurs a
            performance hit, so data is often denormalized for analytics purposes.  An analytics project
            may have tens or even hundreds of denormalization transforms.


        - These types of transformations can be done with Spark, GUI-based tools, or SQL.  AWS Glue Studio
            can be used to design them using a visual interface.


    - Enriching Data

        - Another common transformation is to join tables for the purpose of enriching the original dataset.
            Data that is owned by the organization can be made even more valuable by combining data the
            organization owns with data from third parties, or with data from other parts of the business.

        
        - For example, a company that wants to market credit cards to customers may purchase a database of
            consumer credit scores to match against their customer database.  

          Or a company that knows its sales are impacted by weather conditions may purchase historical and 
            weather forecast data to help them analyze and forecast sales information.


        - AWS provides a data marketplace with the AWS Data Exchange, which has datasets that are free or
            subscription-based.  It's easy to load the data directly into your S3 landing zone.


    - Pre-aggregating Data

        - One of the benefits of data lakes is that they provide a low-cost environment for storing large
            datasets, without needing to preprocess the data or determine the data schema up front.  Then
            if later on, you decide you want to ask new questions of the data, you still have all the
            raw data.

          
        - However, the business may want to ask questions regularly of the data, and the answers may not
            be easily obtained through ad-hoc SQL queries.  As a result, you may create transform jobs
            that run on a scheduled basis to perform the heavy computation that may be required to gain
            the required information from the data.


        - For example, you may create a transform job hat creates a denormalized version of your sales data 
            that includes, among others, columns for the store number, city, and state for each transaction. 

          You may then have a pre-aggregation transform that runs daily to read this denormalized sales data 
            (which may contain tens of millions of rows per day and tens or hundreds of columns) and compute 
            sales, by category, at the store, city, and state level, and write these out to new tables. 


        - You may have hundreds of store managers that need access to store-level data at the category level 
            via a BI visualization tool, but because we have pre-aggregated the data into new tables, the 
            computation does not need to be run every time a report is run.


    - Extracting Metadata from Unstructured Data

        - A data lake may also contain unstructured data, such as audio or image files.  While these files
            cannot be queried directly with traditional analytic tools, we can create a pipeline that uses
            ML and AI services to extract metadata from these unstructured files.


        - For example, a company that employs real estate agents may capture images of all houses for sale.
            One of their DEs could create a pipeline that uses an image service such as Amazon Rekognition
            to automatically identify the type of room.  This captured metadata could then be used in 
            traditional analytics reporting.


        - Another example is a company that stores audio recordings of customer service phone calls.  A
            pipeline could be built that uses an AI tool such as Amazon Transcribe to create transcripts of
            the calls, and then a tool such as Amazon Comprehend could perform sentiment analysis on the
            transcript.

          This would create an output that determines whether sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral
            for each call.  This data could be joined with other data sources to develop a target list of
            customers to send specific marketing communications.



- Working with CDC Data

    - One of the most challenging aspects of working within a data lake environment is the processing of
        updates to existing data, such as with CDC.


    - For example, we complete an initial load of a relational database into the data lake using Amazon 
        DMS.  Then DMS can read the database transaction logs and write all future database updates to
        S3.

      
    - For each row written to S3, the first column of the CDC file would contain one of the following
        characters:

        I    # New row was inserted
        U    # Existing row was updated
        D    # Record was deleted


    - Traditionally, though, it has not been possible to execute updates or deletes to individual records
        within the data lake.  S3 is an object storage service, so you can delete and replace a file but
        you cannot edit a file in place.


    - If you just append new records to the existing data, you will end up with multiple copies of the
        same record, with each record representing the state at a specific point in time.

      This can be useful to have the history of all changes, but we want our end users to be able to work
        with a dataset that contains the current state of each data record.  There are 2 common approaches
        to this, data upserts and a transactional data lake.



- Traditional Approaches - Data Upserts and SQL Views

    - One of the traditional approaches to dealing with CDC data is to run a transform job, on a schedule,
        that effectively merges the new CDC data with the existing dataset, keeping only the latest
        records.  This is known as performing an 'upsert'.


    - One way to do this is to create a transform in Spark that reads in existing data to one DataFrame,
        reads the new data into another DataFrame, then merges them based on custom logic.  The transform
        can then overwrite the existing data or write data to a new date-based partition, creating a new
        snapshot of the source system.

      A certain number of snapshots can be kept, enabling consumers to query data from different points in
        time.


    - There are a few challenges with this approach:

        - These transforms can end up being complex, and it is challenging to create a transform that is
            generic across all source datasets.

        - There can be disruptions for consumers that are trying to read from the dataset while the update
            is running.

        - As the dataset grows, the amount of time and resources needed to read in the full dataset becomes
            a major challenge.


    - In order to create a solution that can be used across multiple datasets, one common approach is to 
        create a configuration table that captures details about source tables.  The config table contains
        information about which column should be considered the PK and a list of columns on which to
        partition the output.

      When the transform job runs, it reads the config table in order to integrate that table's specific
        settings with the logic in the transform job.


    - AWS has a blog post that provides a solution for capturing CDC data, then runs a Glue job to apply
        the latest updates.  A DynamoDB table is used to store config data on the source tables.  There
        is a CloudFormation template with the components needed.


    - An alternative approach is to use 'Athena Views' to create a virtualized table that shows the latest
        state of the data.  The view definition will join the source table with the new CDC data and
        return a result that reflects the latest state of the data.

      This always gives the user the most current state of the data.  However, performance will degrade over 
        time as the CDC table grows, so we need a daily job to consolidate the new CDC data into the
        existing dataset.  Creating and maintaining these views can be fairly complex.



- Modern Approaches - The Transactional Data Lake

    - Over the past few years, the concept of a 'transactional data lake' has become popular.  This refers
        to a data lake that has properties previously only available in a traditional database, like
        updates and deletes.

      In addition, many of these new solutions also provide support for schema evolution and time travel.
        These new formats bring ACID semantics to the data lake.


    - Note that this does not mean that data lakes can replace traditional OLTP DBs.  Data lakes are still
        intended as analytical platforms.  But, these new solutions do simplify the ability to apply
        changes and delete records.


    - AWS Lake Formation Governed Tables

        - Governed tables is new functionality for AWS Lake Formation.  This new S3 table type has been
            designed to support ACID transactions within an S3-based data lake environment.

        - When a table is created and configured as a governed table, Lake Formation handles the
            complexity of allowing multiple users to simultaneously and reliably insert, update, delete,
            and modify records across these tables.

        - Lake Formation also works behind the scenes to automatically compact and optimize the files
            behind the table on a regular basis.


    - Apache Hudi

        - Apache Hudi started out as a project at Uber, was donated to ASF, and became a top-level project
            in 2020.  Today, it is a popular option for building out transactional data lakes to support
            the ability to efficiently upsert new/changed data into a data lake.

        - Hudi also allows you to easily query tables and get the latest updates returned.

        - AWS supports running Hudi within the EMR service.


    - Apache Iceberg

        - Apache Iceberg was created by engineers at Netflix and Apple, and is designed as an open-table
            format for very large datasets.  It was donated to ASF and became a top-level project in
            2020.

        - Iceberg supports schema evolution, time travel, atomic table changes, and support for multiple
            simultaneous writers.

        - In 2021, a new start up call Tabular was formed by the creators of Iceberg to build a cloud-native
            data platform powered by Iceberg.


    - Databricks Delta Lake

        - Databricks, a company founded by the creators of Spark, have created their own approach to 
            providing a transactional data lake, Delta Lake.

        - Delta Lake is an open-format storage layer for streaming and batch operations that provides
            ACID transactions for inserts, updates and deletes.  It also supports time travel.

        - Delta Lake is available both open source and as a fully supported commercial version.
