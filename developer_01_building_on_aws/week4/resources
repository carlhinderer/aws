    Amazon Cognito User Pools

    Create and maintain a user directory and add sign-up and sign-in to your mobile app or web application 
      using user pools. User pools scale to hundreds of millions of users and are designed to provide 
      simple, secure, and low-cost options for you as a developer.

    You can use user pools to add user registration and sign-in features to your apps. Instead of using 
      external identity providers such as Facebook, or Google, you can use user pools to let users register 
      with or sign in to an app using an email address, phone number, or a user name.

    Amazon Cognito User Pools are compliant with SOC 1-3, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and is HIPAA-BAA eligible.


    AWS Certificate Manager

    AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) can help you deploy your SSL/TLS Certificates to your AWS infrastructure 
      such as the Application Load Balancer. If you don't have a certificate, ACM can issue you a 
      certificate as well.


    Securing the connection between your Users and Your Load Balancer

    You can create a listener that uses encrypted connections (also known as SSL offload). This feature 
      enables traffic encryption between your load balancer and the clients that initiate SSL or TLS 
      sessions.



- Encrypting Data in AWS

    Encrypting data in Transit:

    Configure Apache Webserver on Amazon Linux to Use SSL/TLS from EC2 User Guide:
