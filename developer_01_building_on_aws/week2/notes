- Everything in AWS is an API call

    - There are SDKs for calling these APIs in a variety of programming languages
    - We'll use Boto3, the Python AWS SDK

        $ pip install boto3

    - To access the API, we'll need application credentials:

        AWS_ACCESS_KEY
        AWS_SECRET_KEY

    - We'll also associate privileges to the account that corresponds to the keys.

    - We'll also need to install the AWS CLI.



- Exercise 4 - Set Up an IAM User and Configure AWS CLI

    1. Create an AWS IAM policy.
    2. Create an AWS IAM user, attach a policy to the user, and generate access keys.
    3. Create an Amazon EC2 instance and configure AWS CLI with the access keys of the 
         AWS IAM user edXProjectUser.
    4. Install Boto 3 on the instance and explore Boto 3 APIs.
    5. Terminate the Amazon EC2 instance.
