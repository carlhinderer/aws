Exercise 3

In this exercise, you will start laying the infrastructure for the course project by 
  creating a VPC and subnets via an AWS CloudFormation template. You will create more AWS 
  resources in these subnets in the subsequent exercises.

You will also create an Amazon EC2 instance and learn how to connect to it using an SSH client. 
  You use an SSH client for remote login and administration over an authenticated secure channel. 
  You will then look at the log files on the instance and extract information from the instance 
  metadata and user data script.


1. Launch an AWS CloudFormation template to create VPC and subnets.

    In this section, you will create a VPC and subnets by launching an AWS CloudFormation template. If 
      you are familiar with AWS CloudFormation, you may want to attempt to complete this section by 
      using the properties below before reading the step-by-step instructions.
    
      > AWS Console > Services > CloudFormation
      > Create Stack
    
        Region: Oregon (us-west-2)
        CloudFormation template: Upload vpc.template template
        Name of the stack: edx-vpc-stack

      > In your AWS Management Console home page, in the AWS services search textbox at the top, type 
          VPC, and then select VPC to open the VPC dashboard.

      > In the VPC dashboard, on the left navigation menu, click Your VPCs. You will see a VPC named 
          edx-build-aws-vpc in the list. Write down the vpc-id of the edx-build-aws-vpc. You will need 
          the vpc-id in subsequent exercises.

          vpc-0ee929f6d87b19b52

      > In the VPC dashboard, on the left navigation menu, click Subnets. You will see four subnets 
          starting with edx-subnet-xxxx. Write down the subnet-id of edx-subnet-public-a. You will need 
          the subnet-id in subsequent exercises.

2. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance with a user data script in a VPC.

    In this section, you will launch an Amazon EC2 instance with an user data script. If you are 
      familiar with Amazon EC2, you may want to attempt to complete this section by using the properties 
      below before reading the step-by-step instructions.
    
      Region: Oregon (us-west-2)
      Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Amazon Linux AMI
      Instance Type: t2.micro
      Network VPC: edx-build-aws-vpc
      Subnet: edx-subnet-public-a
      User data script: Same one from exercise 2
      Tag: Ex3WebServer
      Security group name: exercise3-sg
      Security group rules: Allow HTTP and SSH
      Key Pair: Create a new key pair and save it for later use.
                  > Download it to a safe place, we'll use it for the rest of the course.

    > Paste the public IP address of your instance in your web browser to display the welcome web
        page. This page is now displaying dynamic information about your server.


3. Connect to your Amazon EC2 instance.

    In this section, you will connect to your Amazon EC2 instance via SSH. An SSH connection requires 
      port 22 to be open on your network. You may need to contact your network administrator to ensure 
      that this is open.

    For MAC/Linux users:

    > Open the Terminal application.

    > Type the commands below. In both commands, replace PATH-TO-PEM-FILE with a reference to the .pem 
        file that you downloaded while launching the instance. In the second command, replace PUBLIC-IP 
        with the IPv4 Public IP of the instance.

      $ chmod 400 PATH-TO-PEM-FILE
      $ ssh -i PATH-TO-PEM-FILE ec2-user@PUBLIC-IP
    
      You will see a prompt like the one below. Answer yes to the prompt.

      The authenticity of host '54.201.7.240 (54.201.7.240)' can't be established. ECDSA key 
        fingerprint is SHA256:TrCPkFBL0F+pTp3LH+UGFPhGjl7N4qaoLucu21RWsRM. Are you sure you want to 
        continue connecting (yes/no)?


4. View log file, query instance metadata, and user data.

     In this section, you will inspect the cloud-init logs to verify the steps in the UserData 
       script executed on the Amazon EC2 Instance. Then, you will query the instance metadata service 
       from the Amazon EC2 instance so that you can see how your application is printing information 
       about itself on the welcome page.

     > To view the log file, type the command below in your instance terminal.

         $ cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

       Explore the log file to see the log entries generated for installing the user data script.


     > To view the instance metadata, type the command below:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/


     > Execute the command below to get the instance identity document of your instance:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document


     > Execute the command below to get the instance public IP address:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4


     > Execute the command below to get the MAC address of the instance:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/mac

     > Execute the command below to get the VPC ID in which the instance resides. Make sure to replace
         Your-MAC in the command below with the MAC address of your instance:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/Your-MAC/vpc-id


     > Execute the command below to get the subnet-id in which the instance resides. Make sure to replace
         Your-MAC in the command below with the MAC address of your instance:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/Your-MAC/subnet-id


     > Execute the command below to get the instance user data:

         $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data


    > Go to the EC2 dashboard in your console, locate the Amazon EC2 instance you created and verify 
        the public IP address, the VPC ID and the subnet-id of the instance you just queried in the 
        instance terminal. You should be able see this information in the Description tab at the bottom.


5. Terminate the Amazon EC2 instance.

In this section, you will terminate the Amazon EC2 instance by selecting the instance in the EC2 
  dashboard and clicking Actions -> Instance State -> Terminate .
