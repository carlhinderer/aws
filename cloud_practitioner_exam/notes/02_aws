| CHAPTER 2 - AWS & THE GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE                         |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- AWS

    - AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon, is the largest cloud-computing provider in the world.  It offers over
        175 distinct services to clients from data centers located across the globe.  These services are
        accessible over the internet on a metered pay-as-you-go model.


    - History of AWS

        2002 = AWS platform launched internally
        2006 = Official launch of SQS, EC2, S3
        2010 = Amazon retail site migrated to AWS
        2015 = One million active customers each month in 190 countries



- AWS Global Infrastructure

    - An AWS Region is a physical location where a cluster of data centers is hosted.  Within each region,
        data centers are built such that small groups of the large cluster are separated by a distance 
        that falls within 60 miles of each other.  These logically and physically separated groups of
        data centers form Availability Zones (AZs).

    - AWS currently spans 77 AZs within 24 geographical regions around the world.



- Regions

    - A Region will consist of a minimum of 2 AZs, and many consist of 3+.  The 'us-east-1' region in
        northern Virginia consists of 6 AZs.  Most new services are launched in this region.


    - Benefits of AWS's multiple-region strategy for customers:

        - Put infrastructure closer to customers, reducing latency
        - Put within political/national borders to adhere to sovreignty and compliance regulations
        - Isolate groups of resources from each other for failover and DR scenarios in case outages occur


    - Many services are based on regions, so you need to select a region you want to deploy a service into.



- AZs

    - AZs are the logical and physical grouping of data centers withing a given Region.  An AZ is a logical
        representation of a metropolitan area where AWS has deployed one or more data center facilities.

    - The primary purpose of having multiple AZs is to offer customers the opportunity to build 
        highly-available, fault-tolerant, and scalable solutions.  This is made possible by the fact that
        AZs within a Region are connected to each other over high-bandwidth, low-latency private metro-fiber
        links, delivering high throughput connections between the zones.

    - You can achieve synchronous replication between AZs.  This means that you can deploy multiple copies
        of your application on servers across the AZs.  If there is an outage at one of the AZs, you can
        continue to serve customers with replicas running in other AZs.

    - This design is possible because we can put replica servers in multiple AZs and distribute end-user
        traffic using an AWS ELB, which monitors the health of the servers and sends traffic only to
        servers that are online and responding.



- Edge Locations

    - In addition to Regions and AZs, AWS also offers another type of hosting service called 'edge locations'.
        These edge locations also host the physical server infrastrucutre, storage devices, and networking
        equipment.  In addition, edge computing services provide infrastructure that enables data to be
        processed closer to the end customer.  This includes deploying AWS-managed hardware and software
        outside of AWS data centers.

    - For example, imagine that you store large media files in the North Virginia region, and your Australian
        users want to access those files.  With edge locations, you can cache frequently accessed files
        on servers closer to the users.

    - AWS CloudFront is a prime tenant of edge location services.  This is a CDN service designed to help
        you create distribution points for your content.  The distribution points are created at these
        edge locations in each Region, and content is then cached at the edge locations closest to the
        end users that attempt to access your content.

    - Edge locations do more than just cache content.  For S3 allows you to upload any data to buckets.
        S3 Transfer Acceleration allows you to upload your content via these edge locations.  Once your
        data reaches an edge location closer to you, it then traverses the AWS backbone using high-speed
        links, greatly increasing your upload speeds.

    - Edge locations are connected to AWS regions through the AWS backbone network, which comprises fully
        redundant, multiple 100-GB parallel fiber connections.

    - Edge locations do have some limitations in that their cache size will fill up over time, and they
        will evict content not recently accessed.  To reduce the number of times this happens, AWS also
        offers Regional Edge Caches.  These caches have larger sizes and can hold data for a longer
        period of time than the edge locations.



- Regional and Global Services

    - Most services on AWS are Region-based, so you must choose the Region you want to deploy your resource
        into.  This is because the underlying infrastructure will reside in the Region you are working in.
        You'll also need to know the region your resource is deployed in to access it.


    - There are some services that are Global.  You can directly access these services from any Region.
        The following services are examples of Global services:

        - AWS IAM - Service that enables you to grant access to services and resources in your AWS account.
                      IAM allows you to create IAM users, define permissions, configure groups, and set up
                      roles.

        - AWS CloudFront - A CDN service that allows you to create distribution points for your content for a
                             specific origin server.  The CloudFront services will cache content locally at
                             edge locations closest to the users that request your content.

        - AWS Route53 - A fully-managed cloud DNS

        - AWS S3 - Although buckets are created in a specific Region, the service is presented as a global
                     service.  When you access the S3 console, you do not need to pick a Region.  All buckets
                     across all Regions are listed.



- On-Premises Services

    - Amazon Snow Family

        - These are physical enclosure units that contain SSDs, compute hardware, and networking components
            shipped to client sites.

        - The Snow Family comprises Snowball Edge Devices, Snowcone, and Snowmobile.

        - They can be used to copy PB of data onto the devices, which are then returned to AWS to be copied into
            S3.  They offer compute capability so that data can be processed and analyzed while being copied.


    - Amazon Storage Gateway

        - This enables users to connect their on-premises storage with S3.

        - Depending on the configuration chosen, Storage Gatweay can maintain a small subnet of frequently
            accessed data locally, with the bulk of data in S3.


    - Amazon Outposts

        - This is a 42U rack that can scale from 1-96 racks to create pools of compute and storage capacity, hosted
            at your local data center.  The 'U' is a standard 1.75-inch-height rack space.

        - Amazon Outposts offers EC2 and RDS services on premise.  This enables low-latency, local data processing,
            and adherence to data-residency requirements.  ECS, EKS, and EMR clusters can also be run locally, as
            can S3.



- AWS Support Plans

    - Basic Support Plan

        - Every AWS account is subscribed to the Basic support plan.  It is free and offers support for account-related
            issues like bill payment and logging in.  You also get access to documentation and forums.

        - These services can be accessed via email, chat, and phone.

        - You also get access to 7 basic checks on the Trusted Advisor tool, which helps you identify best practices
            for performance and security.

        - You get alerts regarding interruptions to any AWS services on your Personal Health Dashboard.


    - Developer Support Plan

        - The Developer plan is recommended if you are experimenting or testing on AWS.  This helps with support of
            non-production workloads that don't support any critical business requirement, and is offered at a low
            price.

        - This plan is limited to generic support primarily around technical configurations.  The support team will not
            be able to discuss specific application-layer problems you are having.

        - Support is available only via email during business hours.


    - Business Support Plan

        - The Business plan is recommended for production environments and enables companies to get technical support
            with their workloads.  One example is an RDS instance that failed and a restore from backup needs to be
            performed.

        - Support is available 24/7 via email, chat, and phone.  Response times vary based on severity of the issue.

        - Support includes troubleshooting interoperability between AWS resources and third party software.

        - For an additional cost, you can get access to AWS IEM (Infrastructure Event Management).  This service offers
            guidance and operational support to help with project launch events or migration tasks.  The service
            includes readiness checks, risk mitigation, support during the launch, and a post-event review.

        - You also receive a full set of Trusted Advisor checks.


    - Enterprise Support Plan

        - The Enterprise plan offers the best support, and starts at $15K per month.  This is appropriate for very
            very large organizations.

        - A TAM (Technical Account Manager) is assigned to your account.  They will actively monitor your environment
            and guide your team through projects.  They can also provide access to the best experts within AWS.

        - You'll get a 15-minute response time for business-critical issues.



- Dashboards

    - AWS publishes service health status across all data centers located in it's various Regions on the Service
        Health Dashboard.

        https://status.aws.amazon.com


    - More tailored information that affectus your applications and resources is displayed on the Personal Health
        Dashboard.  This includes proactive notifications, troubleshooting guidance, and integration with CloudWatch
        events.
