- The 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

    1. Trade capital expense for variable expense (CAPEX for OPEX)

        - Pay for infrastructure only as you need it, instead of huge upfront capital expenditures
        - Only pay for resources that you are actively using
        - Redirect business capital to more important areas of investment


    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

        - AWS gets much better prices on hardware
        - Can hvae components manufactured to their specifications


    3. Stop guessing capacity

        - Previously, predicting for future growth often led to overprovisioning
        - This would be detrimental to balance sheets due to rapid depreciation
        - Underprovisioning would lead to poor performance


    4. Increase speed and agility

        - Provision infrastructure in a few mouse clicks
        - Build test and development environments, then just terminate them when you are done


    5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

        - Building on-prem data centers has hidden costs, like engineers, real estate, and HVAC
        - You don't have to worry about expensive maintenance contracts for hardware


    6. Go global in minutes

        - You have complete access to all regions, providing lower latency and superior customer experience
        - Having multiple copies of resources also helps with disaster recovery and continuity
        - Allows you to meet compliance or regulatory requirements related to where data is stored



- Virtualization

    - Virtualization technologies and hypervisors allow multiple VMs to be deployed on a single server.
        A hypervisor allows physical hardware components of a single server to be emulated as multiple
        virtual components.

    - The hypervisor is responsible for enabling the OSs and applications running on VMs to access the
        physical hardware in a manner that is controlled and isolates the resources from each other.

    - Cloud providers provide the ability to provision virtualized infrastructure resources.



- Cloud Computing Models

    - IaaS

        - Customers configure the underlying network, storage, and compute services that power their LOB
            applications.  This is similar to owning and managing your own infrastructure, however the
            components are virtualized.

        - Ideal if you need greater control over how components need to be configured.

        - Examples include EC2, EBS, and EFS.


    - PaaS

        - Removes the burden of configuring and managing underlying resources, such as compute, storage,
            and network services.  Gives you a platform to to deploy and manage your applications.

        - Cloud provider provisions and manages network architecture, firewall rules, storage, compute
            services, OS management, and runtime environments.

        - Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS OpsWorks, AWS Lambda, and AWS RDS.  Other examples
            include Azure Functions and Google App Engine.


    - SaaS

        - Applications are completely hosted and managed by the provider.  You simply connect to these
            applications via the internet and consume the services offered.  Since applications are accessed
            via a web browser, installing client software is usually not required.

        - You still often need either in-house expertise with the software or support from the provider
            or third parties to configure the services for your business.

        - Examples include Salesforce, GoToMeeting, MS Office 365, and Amazon Chime.



- Cloud Deployment Models

    - Public Cloud

        - A business consumes IT services from a third-party vendor, such as AWS, over the internet.  This
            is by far the most popular model.

        - Generally paid for on a pay-as-you-go model, helping you transition from CAPEX to OPEX.  You are
            charged based on how much you consume.

        - Customers are offered a self-service capability and access to management consoles, command-line
            interfaces, and APIs to configure and consume the services on offer.


    - Private Cloud

        - A business procures, installs, configures, and manages all the necessary infrastructure and
            software components in house.  This is different from traditional on-premises IT in that
            additional management software is deployed to allow different parts of the business to carry
            out self-service tasks from an available catalog of services.

        - Highly customizable to suit the needs of your organization.



    - Hybrid Cloud

        - This is a combination of IT services deployed both on-premises and integrated with one or more
            third-party providers.

        - Connectivity options between an on-premises environment and a cloud provider include setting up
            a secure IPSec-based VPN tunnel over the public internet or establishing a dedicated fiber-based
            connection that bypasses the public internet altogether.

        - Generally also used to improve Disaster Recovery projects, where services can be hosted in 
            multiple places.
